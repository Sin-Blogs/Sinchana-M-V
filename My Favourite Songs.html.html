    <h1>My Favourite Songs</h1> 
    <p>What does songs make us feel !<br>
    By hearing music we feel different emotions. Some songs make us feel happy or excited, while others make us feel sad or scared.
    These feelings come from how the song is composed, the instruments used and how performers pay them. Music floods the blood with
    a chemical called dopamine. This chemical in the brain associated with pleasure, motivatation and reward. </p> <br>
