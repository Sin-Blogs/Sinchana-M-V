    <h2>Dogs</h2>
    <p>My Soul Animal is a <strong>Dog</strong> because they are the friendliest animals that I have seen. <br>
       Dogs provide companship and company. They can be comfort to people who crave unconditional interaction with another living being.
        They are termed as 'Man's Best Friend' because can reduce stress, anxiety, ease loneliness, encourage exercise and playfullness, 
        and even improve our cardiovascular health. Caring for an animal can help children grow up more active.
        Dogs also provide valuable companionship with older adults.<br></p><br>

         <h3>5. Pug</h3>
         <p>Pugs are great family dogs and are very playful and affectionate with children. Also, because of thier mouth shape,
            pugs have trouble delivering an aggressive bite and so are considered a kid-safe breed spectrum. And it is one of
            the oldest dog breeds. </p>
